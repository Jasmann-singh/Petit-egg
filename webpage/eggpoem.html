        <h1>Egg Poems</h1>
        <p>The following are the poems on my favorite egg <strong>"Oeuf frere"</strong></p>
        <p>the first poem:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Ode to Small Egg (Anant Saini) 🥚♟️</h2></li>
            <li>In the land of laughter, where legends are born,<br>
                Lives Anant Saini, of the chuckle and yawn.<br>
                A heart full of gold, and kindness so big—<br>
                Yet he's known to his friends as “the small egg,” no fig.<br></li>
            
            <li>"Petit Oeufs," we say, in a fancy French flair,<br>
                For eggs so petite, they float light in the air.<br>
                Delicate treasures, a marvel to see,<br>
                Like Easter came early, just for you and me.<br></li>
            <li>But wait—on the chessboard, a twist in the plot,<br>
                Where queens go missing, more often than not.<br>
                With bold, brave moves (and a touch of despair),<br>
                He blunders his queen like he just doesn't care.<br></li>

            <li>Yet still, in defeat or victorious grin,<br>
                He’s loyal and warm, a gem deep within.<br>
                We jest and we tease, but always with cheer,<br>
                For Small Egg, dear Anant, we hold you near.<br></li>

            <li>So here’s to the egg that’s tiny, not tall,<br>
                To the blunderer king who still stands proud and tall.<br>
                You’re one of a kind, a friend tried and true—<br>
                Oh, Small Egg Anant, the world’s better with you. 💛<br></li>

        </ul>

        <p>The second Poem</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Anant "Small Egg" Saini’s Adventure 🥚🎉</h2></li>
            <li>Anant Saini, Petit Oeufs, so tiny and neat,<br>
                Your eggs are so small, they can’t even compete!<br>
                They’re like little secrets, too shy to be seen,<br>
                Just hiding in the shell, you know what I mean?<br></li>

            <li>On the chessboard, oh, you’re quite the sight,<br>
                You move your queen like she’s lost in the night.<br>
                “Where’s she going?” we ask with concern,<br>
                But hey, it’s all part of your unique turn!<br></li>
            <li>You sacrifice her like she’s got a vacation planned,<br>
                While we sit there confused, trying to understand.<br>
                But somehow you still pull out a surprise,<br>
                And we all wonder—are you playing with lies?<br></li>

            <li>Your eggs may be small, and your moves even funnier,<br>
                But your heart’s the biggest, no need to worry, sir!<br>
                You’re a legend, a friend, and a joy to be around,<br>
                Even if your queen’s always lost and never found.<br></li>

            <li>So here’s to you, Small Egg, so quirky and bright,<br>
                Your eggs may be small, but your spirit takes flight.<br>
                We laugh, we joke, but you’re the best we know—<br>
                Even if your chess game’s more “Whoa, whoa, WHOA!” 😄<br></li>
        </ul>
